In this book we shall consider intricate, complicated, and diffi-
cult algorithms as well as elegant, simple, and easy ones. Our challenge is to understand
the former and to appreciate the latter in the context of scientific and commercial ap-
plications. 

We use only a small subset of Java. 

We refer to the programming constructs, software libraries, and operating system
features that we use to implement and describe algorithms as our programming model.

We assume that you have experience programming
in some modern language, so that you are likely to recognize many of these features in
this code.
